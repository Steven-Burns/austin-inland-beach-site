        <h2>We are a not-for-profit endeavor.</h2>
        <p class="body-text">A minimum of 10% of gross proceeds from all bookings are donated to charity. *All*
            remaining proceeds are used solely to defray our operating costs. We feel we have been blessed and should do
            what's
            reasonable to share.</p>
        <p class="body-text">We are honored to use your bookings to support the following causes:</p>

            we hosted a fundraiser "walk-a-thon" (swim-a-thon?) to benefit Flora's Walk and the Canadian Perinatal
            Mental Health Collaborative. We contributed
            pool and outdoor kitchen use as well as a voucher for a future pool visit. $1700 was raisied.</p>

        <h2>Cynical?</h2>
        <p class="body-text">Some sour souls might scoff at the idea that we don't do this strictly for the cash. "If
            you're so
            charitable, then why isn't the pool free?" these cynics say. </p>
        <p class="body-text">Operating the pool ain't cheap. Expenses
            include Swimply platform fees, maintenance, chemicals, cleaning, insurance, water, repair, landscaping, endlessly replacing 
            popped floaty toys, etc.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Lamentably, one need only look at how poorly public lands and common facilities are treated
            in our society to recognize that not everone is trustworthy nor acts in good faith. We feel that our booking
            fees are low enough to be accessible to most people of good conscience, but high enough to prevent abuses
            that would ruin the whole thing for everyone.</p>
        <p class="body-text">The minimum 10% that we donate comes right off the top: from our gross proceeds, whether or
            not there has been or will be an expense not covered by the booking revenue.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">Why 10%? Because that is the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/3?lang=eng&id=8-11#p8">law of the tithe.</a></p>
