        <h1>Welcome to the Austin Inland Beach!</h1>

        <p class="body-text">
            Thank you for booking our <a href="https://swimply.com/pooldetails/14726">pool and event space</a>! We are
            confident you
            will have a pleasant time.</p>
        <p class="body-text" style="font-weight:bold;color:#00B0F0">Please contact us through the Swimply app / website
            to ask
            questions or report any issues.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Your hosts will be on-site (but out-of-sight!) for the duration of your visit
            to see to any needs. We are always open to feedback on your experience.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Below are some instructions to make your visit a breeze.</p>

        <h2>Rules </h2>

        <ul type=disc>
            <li class="body-text">No smoking anything, anywhere on the property.</li>
            <li class="body-text">No headfirst diving. The water is not deep enough for diving.</li>
            <li class="body-text">No glass on or near the pool deck or in the water.</li>
            <li class="body-text">No food or drinks in the pool or hot tub.</li>

            <li class="body-text">Please play music at a respectful volume level.</li>

                sticks, alligators, etc.).</li>
            <li class="body-text">No confetti, party streamers, wedding rice, etc. Such things blow into
                the pool and clog the filters.</li>
            <li class="body-text">No dumping anything but water into patio drain.</li>
            <li class="body-text">No pets or non-humans.</li>

            questions or issues.</b></p>

        <h2>Parking</h2>

        <p class="body-text">Park in either driveway: the semicircular driveway on
            the north or the side driveway on the east. You may also park on the street, but please prefer the
            driveways.</p>

        <h2>Safety</h2>

        <p class="body-text">Obey all pool rules. The rules are for your safety.</p>
        <!--
        <p class="body-text">A lifesaver ring buoy is on the wall under the bar counter.</p>
-->
        <p class="body-text">Reaching poles are on the back of the wall by the pool pumps.</p>

        <p class="body-text">We urge you to please designate one or more Water Watchers to act as
            lifeguards. Monitor children at all times. Hand off designation of Water Watcher between adults as needed.
            Water Watcher wristbands are available on the bar countertop</p>

        <p class="body-text">From <a href="https://www.safekids.org/poolsafety">safekids.org</a>:</p>

        <div style="padding:0px 20px 0px">
            <p>"When children are swimming and there are several adults present, make sure kids are actively supervised
                at all times by choosing a Water Watcher. A Water Watcher is a responsible adult who agrees to watch the
                kids in the water without distractions and wear a Water Watcher card. After a certain amount of time
                (such as 15-minutes), the Water Watcher card is passed to another adult, who is responsible for the
                active supervision."</p>
        </div>

        <p class="body-text">A First Aid kit is on the bar countertop.</p>

        <p class="body-text">The hosts are CPR trained. However, they are NOT
            monitoring your activity. If you need to reach them in an emergency, knock and
            call into the house loudly <b>after calling 911</b>.</p>

        <p class="body-text">Please remove
            all water toys from the pool at the conclusion
            of your swim. Toys in the pool tempt little ones to jump back into the water
            unobserved.</p>

        <p class="body-text">Water
            toys are NOT a substitute for life preservers/vests
            for non-swimmers. Life preservers are not provided.</p>

        <p class="body-text">Hard surfaces can get hot in the sun and slippery when wet. Sandals are recommended.</p>

        <h2>Additional Guests</h2>

        <p class="body-text">All
            guests of any age must be registered as attendees
            in the Swimply app booking, no matter what activities they may participate in and <b>even if they do not
                enter the pool</b>.
            This is a requirement of the liability insurance.</p>
        <p class="body-text">You can add guests during your booking with the Swimply app.</p>

        <h2>Waivers</h2>

        <p class="body-text">Each person *must* sign the waiver provided on arrival. <b>This includes even those that do
                not enter the water</b>.
            Each family may have an adult parent or guardian sign a single waiver to cover the entire family.
        </p>

        <a class="button-link-img-a" href="liability-waiver.docx" style="width:fit-content">
            <p class="body-text">View Waiver</p>
        </a>

        <h2>Bathroom</h2>

        <p class="body-text">Enter the house through the door that is left of the
            east fireplace, at the outdoor kitchen area. Follow the WC signs.</p>
        <img class="blue-background-img" src="images/restroom-sign.svg" height="100" />

        <h2>Infants / Toddlers</h2>

        <p class="body-text">Please use swim diapers for children that are not yet
            toilet trained. Do not dispose of diapers of any sort in the toilet.</p>
        <p class="body-text">We keep a small supply of swim diapers should you run out.</p>

        <h2>Fireplaces</h2>

        <p class="body-text">Add the Fireplaces amenity to your booking to use either or both of the
            patio fireplaces. Fireplaces are wood-burning. Firewood is provided.
            Use of hot dog / marshmallow cookers and a "hobo pie iron" is included.</p>

        <h2>No Glass</h2>

            the
            pool deck or in the pool or hot tub. Broken glass is nearly invisible when wet, and very dangerous.</p>

        <p class="body-text">If you break
            a glass item near the pool deck, we must assume that some glass entered the water, and you will be charged
            $500 to cover the cost of draining, cleaning, and refilling the pool.</p>

        <h2>Grill / Outdoor Kitchen</h2>

        <p class="body-text">Add the Grill / Outdoor Kitchen Amenity to
            your booking and you have access to the grill, stock pot burner, east fireplace,

            baking plates covering all or half of the cooking surface. The plates work well
            for baking or warming pizza, bread, tortillas, pupusas, etc.</p>

        <h3>Honor Snack/Soda Bar</h3>

        <p class="body-text">Snacks and sodas are kept in the outdoor fridge. Help yourself. Pay what you think is fair
            by using our <a href="venmo.html">Venmo.</a></p>
        <h3>Toaster Oven</h3>

        <p class="body-text">Fresh baked cookies or brownies by the pool? Yes

        <h3>Ceiling fans</h3>

        <p class="body-text">The fans
            are controlled with the circular pads on the

        <h2>About the Pool</h2>

        <p class="body-text">The pool is a saltwater system. This
            means that the water is soft and silky. The water is also gentler on skin,
            eyes, and swimwear as chlorine levels needed to maintain clean water are much
            lower than that of a regular pool. The salt concentration is less than that of
            human tears.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="body-text">Swimming in salt water also appears to offer health benefits. A <a
                href=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355985483_Thalassotherapy_Health_Benefits_of_Sea_Water_Climate_and_Marine_Environment_A_Narrative_Review:>horizontal
                review</a> of thalassotherapy
            research showed that "[c]linical efficacy of thalassotherapy was mostly tested for skin problems (psoriasis,
            atopic
            dermatitis, vitiligo) and rheumatic disorders (fibromyalgia, ankylosing spondylitis). Disease severity and
            the patients’ quality of life significantly improved after intervention, with the majority of evidence for
            psoriasis and fibromyalgia. Thalassotherapy can be associated with symptomatic improvements in some health
            conditions." <a
                href="https://www.insider.com/doctors-explain-why-people-feel-better-near-the-ocean-2023-7">More
                on benefits of salt water swimming.</a>

        </p>
        <p class="body-text">The pool
            is lined with black and mother-of-pearl
            pebbles that are comfy to the touch and absorb sunshine to warm the water. We believe the effect resembles
            the Mediterranean sea off Mykonos, Greece.</p>
<img src="images/photos/Mykonos.jpg"/>
        <h2>How We Clean</h2>

        <p class="body-text">The pool is strictly maintained to have pH-neutral, clean,
            clear, algae-free water. A salt water chlorination generator is used to continually
            produce chlorine in low (1-4 ppm) concentrations: sufficient to kill all microbial
            contaminants, but not produce eye or skin irritation.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">On the day of your arrival, the pool will have been professionally
            tested and balanced.</p>

        <p class="body-text">(A pool that smells heavily of chlorine is NOT clean: strong chlorine
            odor is an indicator of improper chemical balancing and signals the presence of sweat,
            oils, fecal material, and urine in the water. Eeew. <a

                the CDC on chloramines</a>.) </p>

        <p class="body-text">Upholstery, chaises, and chairs are wiped down prior to your
            arrival with OxyClean disinfectant. All countertops and cooking surfaces are
            cleaned with appropriate clensers and are disinfected.</p>
