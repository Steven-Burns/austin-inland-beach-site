            <p class="body-text">Each participant *must* supply a signed waiver on arrival. <b>This includes even those
                    that
                    do
                    not enter the water</b>. Paper copies are available. You can download the waiver and bring a copy
                signed
                in advance. A parent or legal guardian must sign for every minor.
                Each family may have an adult parent or guardian sign a single waiver to cover the entire family.

                <li class="body-text">No smoking anything, anywhere on the property.</li>
                <li class="body-text">No headfirst diving. The water is not deep enough for diving.</li>
                <li class="body-text">No glass on or near the pool deck or in the water.</li>
                <li class="body-text">No food or drinks in the pool or hot tub.</li>

                <li class="body-text">No confetti, party streamers, wedding rice, etc. Such things blow into

                <li class="body-text">No pets or non-humans.</li>

            <h2>Parking</h2>

            <p class="body-text">Park in either driveway: the semicircular driveway on
                the north or the side driveway on the east. You may also park on the street, but please prefer the
                driveways. The east driveway is the most convenient to the gate.</p>

            <h2>Entrance</h2>

            <p class="body-text">Enter through the east gate. There is a blue Welcome sign on the gate. A host will
                greet
                you at the start of your booking.</p>

            <h2>Safety</h2>

            <p class="body-text">Obey all pool rules. The rules are for your safety.</p>
            <!--
        <p class="body-text">A lifesaver ring buoy is on the wall under the bar counter.</p>
-->
            <p class="body-text">Reaching poles are on the back of the wall by the pool pumps.</p>

            <p class="body-text">We urge you to please designate one or more Water Watchers to act as
                lifeguards. Monitor children at all times. Hand off designation of Water Watcher between adults as
                needed.
                Water Watcher wristbands are available on the bar countertop</p>

            <p class="body-text">From <a href="https://www.safekids.org/poolsafety">safekids.org</a>:</p>

            <div style="padding:0px 20px 0px">
                <p>"When children are swimming and there are several adults present, make sure kids are actively
                    supervised
                    at all times by choosing a Water Watcher. A Water Watcher is a responsible adult who agrees to watch
                    the
                    kids in the water without distractions and wear a Water Watcher card. After a certain amount of time
                    (such as 15-minutes), the Water Watcher card is passed to another adult, who is responsible for the
                    active supervision."</p>
            </div>

            <p class="body-text">A First Aid kit is on the bar countertop.</p>

            <p class="body-text">The hosts are CPR trained. However, they are NOT
                monitoring your activity. If you need to reach them in an emergency, knock and
                call into the house loudly <b>after calling 911</b>.</p>

            <p class="body-text">Please remove
                all water toys from the pool at the conclusion
                of your swim. Toys in the pool tempt little ones to jump back into the water
                unobserved.</p>

            <p class="body-text">Water
                toys are NOT a substitute for life preservers/vests
                for non-swimmers. Life preservers are not provided.</p>

            <p class="body-text">Hard surfaces can get hot in the sun and slippery when wet. Sandals are recommended.
            </p>

            <h2>Additional Guests</h2>

            <p class="body-text">All guests of any age must be registered as attendees
                in the booking, no matter what activities they may participate in and <b>even if they do not
                    enter the pool</b>.
                This is a requirement of the liability coverage.</p>
            <p class="body-text">You can add guests during your booking with the booking app.</p>

            <h2>Additional Time</h2>

            <p class="body-text">Want to add more time to your booking? Talk to a host. We usually can accomodate
                extensions
                if there is no conflicting booking after you.</p>

            <h2>Bathroom</h2>

            <p class="body-text">Enter the house through the door that is left of the
                east fireplace, at the outdoor kitchen area. Follow the WC signs.</p>
            <img class="blue-background-img" src="images/restroom-sign.svg" height="100" />

            <h2>Amenities</h2>

            <p class="body-text">See the <a href="amenities.html">Amenities</a> page for instructions for each.</p>

            <h2>Infants / Toddlers</h2>

            <p class="body-text">Please use swim diapers for children that are not yet
                toilet trained. Do not dispose of diapers of any sort in the toilet.</p>
            <p class="body-text">We keep a small emergency supply of swim diapers should you run out.</p>

            <h2>No Glass</h2>

            <p class="body-text">Please do not use glass items (mugs, glass bottles, glass containers, etc.) anywhere
                around
                the pool deck or in the pool or hot tub. Decant beverages into metal or plastic containers. </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                Broken glass is nearly invisible when wet, and very dangerous.</p>

            <p class="body-text">If you break
                a glass item near the pool deck, we must assume that some glass entered the water, and you will be
                charged
                $500 to cover the cost of draining, cleaning, and refilling the pool.</p>

            <h2>Seating</h2>

            <p class="body-text">Here is the provided seating:</p>
            <ul type=disc>

                care
                of putting things back after your event.</p>

            <h2>Umbrellas</h2>

            <p class="body-text">Umbrellas will be set up by the hosts before you
                arrive. If they are not set up, then the breeze is too strong to safely leave
                them unfurled. Please do not open them yourself: they can be tricky in the
                wind.</p>

            <h2>Forget Something?</h2>

            <p class="body-text">Complimentary sunscreen, sunburn gel, and band-aids are available in
                a basket at the outdoor kitchen area.</p>
            <p class="body-text"><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/hYSPqMT1DX6PSUMN6">Randall's</a> full-service grocery is
                about
                3 miles away.

            <h2>Special Arrangements</h2>

            <p class="body-text">If
                you are interested in such things as a bouncy house,
                wedding pavilion, your own yard games or activities, a ferris wheel, pony rides, or anything else that
                strikes your fancy, please discuss with the host at booking time prior to your
                arrival. Surprise additions upon arrival may not be approved.</p>

            <h2>Promotions</h2>

            <p class="body-text">See the current promotions
                <a href="promotions.html">here</a>
            </p>

            <h2>Charitable Causes</h2>

            <p class="body-text">We are a not-for-profit endeavor: a minimum of 10% of gross proceeds of all bookings
                are
                donated to charity.</p>

            <p></p>

            <h2>How We Clean</h2>

            <p class="body-text">The pool is strictly maintained to have pH-neutral, clean,
                clear, algae-free water. A salt water chlorination generator is used to continually
                produce chlorine in low (1-4 ppm) concentrations: sufficient to kill all microbial
                contaminants, but not produce eye or skin irritation.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">On the day of your arrival, the pool will have been professionally
                tested and balanced.</p>

            <p class="body-text">(A pool that smells heavily of chlorine is NOT clean: strong chlorine
                odor is an indicator of improper chemical balancing and signals the presence of sweat,
                oils, fecal material, and urine in the water. Eeew. <a

                    from
                    the CDC on chloramines</a>.) </p>

            <p class="body-text">Upholstery, chaises, and chairs are wiped down prior to your
                arrival with OxyClean disinfectant. All countertops and cooking surfaces are
                cleaned with appropriate clensers and are disinfected.</p>
