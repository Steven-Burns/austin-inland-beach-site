        <h1>Welcome to the Austin Inland Beach!</h1>

        <p class="body-text">
            Thank you for booking our <a href="https://swimply.com/pooldetails/14726">pool</a>! We are confident you
            will have a pleasant time.</p>
        <p class="body-text" style="font-weight:bold;color:#00B0F0">Please contact us through the Swimply app to ask
            questions or
            report any issues.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Your hosts will be on-site (but out-of-sight!) for the duration of your visit
            to see to any needs. We are always open to feedback on your experience.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Below are some instructions to make your visit a breeze.</p>

        <h2>Rules </h2>

        <ul type=disc>
            <li class="body-text">No smoking anything, anywhere on the property.</li>
            <li class="body-text">No headfirst diving. The water is not deep enough for diving.</li>
            <li class="body-text">No glass on the pool deck or in the water.</li>
            <li class="body-text">No food or drinks in the pool or hot tub.</li>
            <li class="body-text">No climbing on or jumping from furniture.</li>
            <li class="body-text">Please play music at a respectful volume level.</li>
            <li class="body-text">No objects in the water except host-approved pool toys (ex: no rocks, 
                sticks, etc.).</li>
            <li class="body-text">No confetti, party streamers, wedding rice, etc. Such things blow into
                the pool and clog the filters.</li>
            <li class="body-text">No dumping anything but water into patio drain.</li>
            <li class="body-text">No pets.</li>

        <p class="body-text" style="font-weight: bold; color:#00B0F0">Contact
            the hosts via the Swimply app with any
            questions or issues.</b></p>

        <h2>Parking</h2>

        <p class="body-text">Park in either driveway: the semicircular driveway on
            the north or the side driveway on the east.</p>

        <h2>Safety</h2>

        <p class="body-text">Obey all pool rules. The rules are for your safety.</p>

        <p class="body-text">A lifesaver ring buoy is on the wall under the bar counter.</p>

        <p class="body-text">Reaching poles are on the wall by the pumps.</p>

        <p class="body-text">Please designate one or more Water Watchers to act as
            lifeguards. Monitor children at all times designate another adult as Water
            Watcher when needed.</p>

        <p class="body-text">A First Aid kit is on the bar countertop.</p>

        <p class="body-text">The hosts are CPR trained. However, they are NOT
            monitoring your activity. If you need to reach them in an emergency, knock and
            call into the house loudly.</p>

        <p class="body-text">Remove
            all water toys from the pool at the conclusion
            of your swim. Toys in the pool tempt little ones to jump back into the water
            unobserved.</p>

        <p class="body-text">Water
            toys are NOT a substitute for life preservers/vests
            for non-swimmers. Life preservers are not provided.</p>

        <h2>Additional Guests</h2>

        <p class="body-text">All
            guests of any age must be registered as attendees
            in the Swimply app booking, no matter what activities they may participate in.
            This is a requirement of the liability insurance.</p>

        <h2>Waivers</h2>

        <p class="body-text">Each family *must* have an adult parent/guardian sign
            the waiver that will be given to you upon arrival. This includes even those that do not
            swim.</p>

        <h2>Bathroom</h2>

        <p class="body-text">Enter the house through the door that is left of the
            east fireplace, at the outdoor kitchen area. Follow the WC signs.</p>
        <img class="blue-background-img" src="images/restroom-sign.svg" height="100" />

        <h2>Infants / Toddlers</h2>

        <p class="body-text">Please use swim diapers for children that are not yet
            toilet trained. Do not dispose of diapers of any sort in the toilet.</p>

        <h2>Safety</h2>

        <p class="body-text">Please supervise children. No lifeguard or active monitoring is provided. </p>

        <p class="body-text">Hard surfaces can get hot in the sun and slippery when wet. Sandals are recommended.</p>

        <p class="body-text">Please do not use glass items (glasses, containers, etc.) anywhere around the
            pool deck or in the pool or hot tub. Broken glass is nearly invisible when wet, and very dangerous.</p>

        <h2>Grill / Outdoor Kitchen</h2>

        <p class="body-text">If you added the Grill / Outdoor Kitchen Amenity to
            your booking, you have access to the grill, stock pot burner, east fireplace,
            icemaker, beverage refrigerator, sink, dining table, bar area and ceiling fans.</p>

            Use of hot dog / marshmallow cookers and a "hobo pie iron" is included.</p>

        <h4>Grill</h4>

        <p class="body-text">The propane grill has 4 burners and a smoker. Cooking utensils are provided.</p>

        <p class="body-text">The
            grill can be rigged on request with heavy steel
            baking plates covering all or half of the cooking surface. The plates work well
            for baking or warming pizza, bread, tortillas, pupusas, etc.</p>

        <h4>Icemaker</h4>

        <p class="body-text">The
            icemaker struggles to keep up with Texas heat, so
            in weather above 80 degrees, you are advised to bring your own ice. Feel free to use the icemaker bin as a cooler.</p>

        <h4>Toaster Oven</h4>

        <p class="body-text">Fresh baked cookies or brownies by the pool? Yes
            please! Let the host know if you want to use the oven.</p>

        <h4>Ceiling fans</h4>

        <p class="body-text">The fans
            are controlled with the circular pads on the
            east wall of the kitchen. Slide the switch to the on position. Set the speed
            with the 1-, 2-, or 3-dot buttons on the circular pads.</p>

        <h2>WiFi</h2>

            have a voucher.&quot;</p>

            basket in the outdoor kitchen area. Each device requires its own code. Codes
            are single-use and grant access for 5 hours. Place used vouchers in the trash.</p>

        <h2>Outdoor speakers</h2>

        <p class="body-text">A
            portable speaker with radio and phone input is
            provided as a free amenity. You will need to bring your own dongle appropriate
            for your phone to connect to the speaker.</p>

        <p class="body-text">Umbrellas will be set up by the hosts before you
            arrive. If they are not set up, then the breeze is too strong to safely leave
            them unfurled. Please do not open them yourself: they can be tricky in the
            wind.</p>

        <p class="body-text">If already opened by the hosts, the large offset umbrella can be rotated at
            the base. Unlatch the mast with the foot pedal at the base. Ask the host for
            help if needed.</p>

        <h2>Toys</h2>

            placed. If you need the canopy relocated, please ask the host.</p>

        <h2>Misting Fan</h2>

        <p class="body-text">If you
            opted for the Misting Fan amenity, please

            outdoor kitchen area, near the chaise loungers, etc.). The fan speed is
            adjusted with the knob on the side of the unit.</p>

        <h2>Yoga Class</h2>

        <p class="body-text">If you

        <h2>About the Pool</h2>

        <p class="body-text">The pool is a saltwater system. This
            means that the water is soft and silky. The water is also gentler on skin,
            eyes, and swimwear as chlorine levels needed to maintain clean water are much
            lower than that of a regular pool. The salt concentration is about the same as
            human tears.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="body-text">The pool
            is lined with black and mother-of-pearl
            pebbles that are comfy to the touch and absorb sunshine to warm the water.</p>
