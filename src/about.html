        <h1>About the Pool</h1>

        <p class="body-text">The pool is a saltwater system. This
            means that the water is soft and silky. The water is also gentler on skin,
            eyes, and swimwear as chlorine levels needed to maintain clean water are much
            lower than that of a regular pool. The salt concentration is less than that of
            human tears.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="body-text">Swimming in salt water also appears to offer health benefits. A <a
                href=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355985483_Thalassotherapy_Health_Benefits_of_Sea_Water_Climate_and_Marine_Environment_A_Narrative_Review:>horizontal
                review</a> of thalassotherapy
            research showed that "[c]linical efficacy of thalassotherapy was mostly tested for skin problems (psoriasis,
            atopic
            dermatitis, vitiligo) and rheumatic disorders (fibromyalgia, ankylosing spondylitis). Disease severity and
            the patients' quality of life significantly improved after intervention, with the majority of evidence for
            psoriasis and fibromyalgia. Thalassotherapy can be associated with symptomatic improvements in some health
            conditions." <a

        <p class="body-text">The pool
            is lined with black and mother-of-pearl
            pebbles that are comfy to the touch and absorb sunshine to warm the water. We believe the effect resembles
            the Mediterranean sea off Mykonos, Greece.</p>

        <h2>How We Clean</h2>

        <p class="body-text">The pool is strictly maintained to have pH-neutral, clean,
            clear, algae-free water. A salt water chlorination generator is used to continually
            produce chlorine in low (1-4 ppm) concentrations: sufficient to kill all microbial
            contaminants, but not produce eye or skin irritation.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">On the day of your arrival, the pool will have been professionally
            tested and balanced.</p>

        <p class="body-text">(A pool that smells heavily of chlorine is NOT clean: strong chlorine
            odor is an indicator of improper chemical balancing and signals the presence of sweat,
            oils, fecal material, and urine in the water. Eeew. <a

                the CDC on chloramines</a>.) </p>

        <p class="body-text">Upholstery, chaises, and chairs are wiped down prior to your
            arrival with OxyClean disinfectant. All countertops and cooking surfaces are
            cleaned with appropriate clensers and are disinfected.</p>
